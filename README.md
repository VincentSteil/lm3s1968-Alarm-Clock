lm3s1968-Alarm-Clock
====================

An alarm clock implemented on the lm3s1968 evaluation board in C using only on-board hardware. One different alarm can be set per weekday. The alarm sound is only there as a proof of concept. I have yet to create a mroe suitable alarm sound to be outputted via the 4-bit dac circuit.
